\textbf{Implementation}
We used a web-based solution with Three.js, a simple and easy to use 3D Framework, for creating the 3D view
and bootstrap for certain ui elements. Everything else made with standard Htlm, css, and Typescript.
It is possible to export the design as two svg files, which contain all the data necessary to print it. \\ 
Tauri, a rust based technology to run web apps on Desktops, is also used to create a way to run the editor without node.js.
A Windows build can be found in the repository and instructions to build it on Mac are also present.
